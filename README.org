* Migrating ACM LaTeX template to Org-mode

** Purpose

Whenever someone wants to hand in a white paper for a
conference which requires using ACM LaTeX template, I want to use an
Org-mode file instead. With the Org-mode LaTeX exporter (the current
one and/or the new one) is should be possible to generate compatible
TeX and PDF output.

** Template Source

http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates

** Additional requirements

The template should be as much self-containing as possible. So no
special settings required in ~$HOME/.emacs~

The file =ACM-template.org= contains everything needed to produce the
ACM paper from an Org-mode file.  It tangles initialization files for
the new exporter and the old exporter.  It writes a Makefile that:
  - launches a fresh instance of Emacs,
  - loads the selected initialization file,
  - then processes the Org-mode file that generated it.
 
The file =sigproc-sp-org-new.org= contains the ACM-SIG LaTeX sample in
Org-mode. The LaTeX output from Org-mode comes close to reproducing
the original, but with a few deviations.  The new exporter looks like
it will be capable of generating a LaTeX file that doesn't need to be
tweaked. 

* Issues

  - Karl 2012-04-25: new Org-mode export does nothing but writing
    "org-splice-latex-header: Wrong type argument: stringp, nil"

  - Tom 2012-05-06: old exporter requires a headline before the first
    source code block.

  - Tom 2012-05-06: new exporter has a known bug that inserts source
    code header information after the source code block disappears, as
    it does with :exports results

  - Tom 2012-05-06: the list of additional authors doesn't separate the
    last author in the list with "and"

  - Tom 2012-05-06: the ACM latex class command \titlenote{} doesn't
    appear to work
